[{"content":"About two years ago, I was in a job I wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly interested in, in a work environment that left me a nervous wreck at all times. To further up the ante, I realized that I was turning 30 soon and that time was growing thin for me to make a major push towards the career and life I wanted.1\n A visual representation, as rendered in Bitsy, of a good portion of my old job. \nNot that you can\u0026rsquo;t make big changes later in life, but\u0026hellip; between a job that made me both stressed out and too complacent, a window closing on my ability to take major life risks without too many responsibilities getting in the way, and the impending dread that I might not make it to 30 let alone middle age due to a society hostile to people that look like me2, the conditions were right for me to take a leap of some sort.\nNow, two years later, I am, in fact, 30. I lived in another country for a year for the first time in my life, and I now hold a master\u0026rsquo;s degree that sums up one very long year of my life. One that was full of immense stress, trauma, grief and anger, but one that also gave me bonds with new people, stronger bonds with people I knew, knowledge on what I didn\u0026rsquo;t know and what I still need to learn, and better knowledge of myself, my abilities and my trajectory. I\u0026rsquo;m not exactly where I want to be yet; after all, I\u0026rsquo;m still battling issues with depression, anxiety, deep shame and self-doubt. But, at the end of the day, I\u0026rsquo;m hopefully more well equipped to continue the march forward, towards the good things that I want for myself and the people around me.\n My view after completing my degree coursework, and having all of the tension in my body escape at once. …to let new tension in, of course. \nAnd thus, I wanted to make a statement of my intent for moving foward. 3\nI\u0026rsquo;m starting this blog as a way to log the things I learn and the projects I work on, whether they have to do with my career aspirations, the work I do for others, or my personal creative practice. I want a place to experiment with learning new things, developing my skills, and further evolving and pushing my own boundaries. Some of this stuff might be useful towards my career development; a lot of it might not. I might also post a few things I\u0026rsquo;ve already done in the past, as a way to cover recent projects or take a look at old ones.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t a portfolio or a professional platform, to be clear. Things may get weird. I hope they do, tbh! I\u0026rsquo;ll likely cuss from time to time, and I might even post things that may not be appropriate workplace viewing.4 I may even post things that seem completely irrelevant to someone trying to get a job making video games. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how that pans out.\nLet the mark of success for this blogging endeavor of mine be the very fact that something I\u0026rsquo;ve made is now released into the wild ether. Whether it be tangible or digital, a finished piece or a sketch, critical or frivolous, celebrated or ignored, \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;bad,\u0026rsquo; it\u0026rsquo;s out there for people to experience in any way they might desire. It\u0026rsquo;s now something that another person can learn from, take delight in, analyze, or even\u0026hellip; *gulp* hate. But more important than any of that, it\u0026rsquo;s out of my head, and it exists. Anything more\u0026rsquo;s a bonus.\nPersonally, I think it\u0026rsquo;s completely justified and very cool for an expression of self to just exist, even if it\u0026rsquo;s a simple declaration that you\u0026rsquo;re here. That\u0026rsquo;s what art is becoming for me as I grow older and maybe wiser; even as critical as I expect myself to be, I can also find it impressive enough for someone to have just made a thing that now exists outside of themselves, even if it\u0026rsquo;s flawed in its execution or possibly shallow in its meaning. That expression is a success in itself! At least, that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to convince myself of; I\u0026rsquo;ll cut a lot of people some slack, but i\u0026rsquo;m still practicing doing the same for myself.\nWell, consider this blog just that; a cool shout saying I\u0026rsquo;m here. Or as a time-traveling demon from a Japanese superhero show once said\u0026hellip;\n “Ore…sanjou!\u0026quot; \n  I even eventually made a game about it, which you can play right here!\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n You know\u0026hellip; gamers\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n You gotta make a statement of intent!\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Such things will be appropriately tagged.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":"2021-06-26T10:00:00-04:00","image":"https://dbsharpy.github.io/blog/post/2021-06-26-im-born/momotaros-ore-sanjou_huc1a6f5ec3c786ac5ec67abc76c390755_102294_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://dbsharpy.github.io/blog/post/2021-06-26-im-born/","title":"I'm Born!"}]
